A game by Middlerun
http://www.middlerun.net

Lövecraft is a 2D mining and building sim in the vein of Minecraft and
Terraria.

Controls:
Move left:           A
Move right:          D
Open inventory:      E
Break block:         Left mouse
Place block:         Right mouse
Select block:        Scroll wheel
Fire grappling hook: Middle mouse
Jump / release hook: Space
Shorten hook line:   W
Lengthen hook line:  S


Requires LÖVE 0.7.2. See http://www.love2d.org for more info.

Lövecraft is currently in a very early stage of development. The current
version can always be found at https://github.com/Middlerun/lovecraft

Despite the name, it has nothing to do with the works of H.P. Lovecraft. I'll
rename it to something less misleading when I think of a good name.


To do:
------

- Crafting
- Tools and items
- More block types
- Fix grappling hook bugs
- Music and sound effects
- Menu screen
- Save/load system
- Let player choose seed for level generation
- Better graphics
- Lighting
- Day/night cycle
- Water
