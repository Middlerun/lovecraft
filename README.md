A game by Middlerun

Lövecraft is a 2D mining and building sim in the vein of Minecraft and
Terraria.

- Lengthen hook line:  S

Built for LÖVE 0.10.1. See [http://www.love2d.org]() for more info.

Despite the name, it has nothing to do with the works of H.P. Lovecraft. I'll
rename it to something less misleading when I think of a good name.
